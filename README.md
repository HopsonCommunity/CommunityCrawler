## Idea
CommunityDungeon (name to be changed is a typical rogue-like RPG Dungeon Crawler consisting of multiple classes such as Warrior, Mage, Ranger, etc. and multiple different-themed dungeon floors, such as "Cave-like" dungeon, "Classic brick-like dungeon", "Frozen Ice dungeon", "Floral Oasis dungeon", and so on.
You start off lost in a cave, and your goal is to make it to the bottom of the Dungeon, whilst fighting evil creatures, unique bosses and more. At the end of every floor, there is a boss covering the path to the next stage.
